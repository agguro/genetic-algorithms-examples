Each example has its own license.  Be carefull not to violate this because I will not be held
responsable, it's between you and the license keeper of the software showed here.
Rewritten examples in assembly language keep the same license as the original source code.

If software should be published here that is from you and you don't agree then probably there
was some misunderstandment in the passed and I will remove it asap.

It's enough to write me an email (admin[AT]agguro[DOT]be) (change words in their respective characters.)
