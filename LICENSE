I don't "cut the crap".  This source code is free for use.  However, if you use it I will not held responsable for errors (likely), broken machines (most unlikely but who knows) or the purpose that you will use it for (very unlikely with this code)
If yo should use it for your own high school or university projects, beware that your professor also has access to this repository.
