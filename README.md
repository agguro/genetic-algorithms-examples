# genetic-algorithms-examples
A set of GA examples

The examples given aren't yet what they should be and based on only one method. (selection, crossover and mutation)
The goal however is to build them in assembly languages and perhaps even with self modifying code, but I still have no clue how to start that.
In the meanwhile.....

    1: random : a program to generate random types of values.
    2: equation_example_01 : 6 variable equation example.
    3: quadratic_equation_example. : problem to deal with: Finding both roots
    4: qubic_equation_example. : problem to deal with: eliminate same results from all the results, the algorithm however do find the 3 roots (most of the time)


Build of the examples.
In each consecutive directory:
    
    mkdir build
    cd build
    qmake ../
    make
