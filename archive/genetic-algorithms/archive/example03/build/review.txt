This algorithm performs better than example 02 in that respect that we only need 1 gene to get both zero points of
a*x*x+b*x+c=0
The number of chromosomes is arbitrarely chosen.
A check on the values of x1 can arrange the output so that only distinct values are displayed. (which should be 2 different or 2 sae roots)
There is still no check if real roots exists.  That's for another example where I will deal with the complex number space.
